## Introduction

**Pet-Project-CICD** is a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline project aimed at learning and experimenting with various technologies and development processes. This project is a work in progress and serves as a playground to acquire knowledge quickly and efficiently.

### Technology Stack

This project leverages a diverse technology stack to explore different aspects of modern software development:

- **Front-end**: Utilizes React, a popular front-end JavaScript library, for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **Back-end**: Employs Python Flask to create the back-end services and APIs that power the application.

- **Database**: Relies on PostgreSQL (PSQL) to manage and store data efficiently.

- **Containerization**: Utilizes Docker and Docker Compose for containerization, making it easy to package and deploy the application.

- **Infrastructure**: Leverages Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC) to provision and manage cloud resources, primarily on AWS.

- **Integration**: Harnesses GitHub Actions to build and automate the CI/CD pipeline.

## Project Description

**Pet-Project-CICD** is a personal endeavor aimed at achieving the following objectives:

- Learn and experiment with a new front-end technology, React, to build engaging and interactive user interfaces.

- Gain hands-on experience in creating a CI/CD pipeline from the ground up, including its design, development, and automation.

As this project is an ongoing work in progress, it represents an excellent opportunity to explore new technologies, refine skills, and learn from challenges.

## Key Challenges

Throughout the development of **Pet-Project-CICD**, you'll encounter a few key challenges, including:

- **React Components**: Learning and mastering the creation of React components to design a responsive and user-friendly front-end.

- **Containerization Process**: Understanding and implementing the containerization process using Docker to ensure consistency and portability across environments.

## Usage

To explore and contribute to this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your development machine:

- **Node.js and NPM**: Install Node.js and NPM to work with the React front-end.

- **Python and Flask**: Install Python and Flask for the back-end.

- **Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed to manage containerization.

- **Terraform**: Install Terraform to work with infrastructure as code.

- **AWS Account**: You'll need an AWS account and appropriate IAM credentials for Terraform operations.

- **GitHub Account**: To leverage GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/czlazlo/Pet-Project-CICD.git
